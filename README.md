# Software-Engineering-CS169---UC-Berkeley
This is my solutions to [Software Engineering](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/berkeleyx-mastering-agile-development-of-software-as-a-service) course (CS169 at UC-Berkeley) for the online version of it on EDX.
The main goals of these assignments is to:
* Articulate the primary differences between Agile and Plan-and-Document methodologies.
* Apply the key ideas of learning a new language in order to construct programs in Ruby.
* Summarize the key architectural elements of RESTful SaaS applications and microservices.
* Apply the key ideas of learning a new framework to 2 construct and deploy simple Rails applications.
* Apply behavior-driven development (BDD) to elicit customer needs and express them as user stories that will drive development.
* Construct unit- and module-level tests and measure their coverage.
* Apply BDD & TDD to identify the main parts of a legacy code base, measure code quality, and refactor code to improve its quality.
* Exercise best practices in planning, effort estimation, and coordination of the efforts of small software teams, using appropriate tools to support those practices.
* Recognize when an appropriate Design Pattern may improve code quality, and refactor code to apply those Design Patterns.
* Identify and repair potential app-level security and performance problems.
